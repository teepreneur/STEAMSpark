# The Problem

## STEAM Education in Africa is Broken

### For Parents
- 🔍 **Hard to find** qualified STEAM tutors (robotics, coding, science)
- ❓ **No visibility** into child's learning progress
- 💸 **Expensive** and inaccessible for most families

### For Educators
- ⏰ **Late payments** (or no payments at all)
- ✂️ **Agencies take 40-50%** of earnings
- 🔒 **No creative freedom** — forced to teach rigid curriculums
- 📉 **No tools** to scale their expertise

> **Result:** Quality STEAM education remains a privilege, not a right.

# Business Model

## Sustainable Revenue Streams

### Primary: Commission on Bookings

| Model | Rate | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Per-Session Fee** | 20% platform commission | Teachers keep 80% |
| **Subscription (Parents)** | GHS 50-100/month | AI roadmaps, multi-child support |
| **Premium (Teachers)** | GHS 100/month | Featured listings, analytics |

### Why 20% vs. Our Previous 50%?

> **Scaling requires empowering educators, not extracting from them.**
>
> Our old manual model took 50% but was impossible to scale. The new 20% model attracts more teachers, grows the marketplace, and builds long-term value.

### Future Revenue
- 📚 **Curriculum Marketplace** — Teachers sell lesson plans
- 🏫 **School Partnerships** — B2B licensing
- 🎓 **Certifications** — Paid credentials
