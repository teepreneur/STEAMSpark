## The Problem

Parents in Ghana struggle to find qualified STEAM tutors, while talented educators face late payments, 40-50% agency cuts, and no tools to scale their expertise.

A two-sided platform where:
- **Educators** own programs, set rates, and get paid on time
- **Parents** access vetted tutors and AI-powered learning roadmaps

---

## Business Model

- **20% commission** on all bookings (teachers keep 80%)
