### 📧 Email 4
**Subject:** Stop trading hours for money 💸
**Preview Text:** How to create "Gigs" that parents can't resist.

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

One of the biggest mistakes tutors make is charging "per hour."

On STEAM Spark, we encourage **Course Packages.**

**Why?**
*   **For You:** Higher upfront earnings and a committed student.
*   **For Parents:** A clear goal and a guaranteed outcome.

**Example:**
*   **Old Way:** "Math Tuition - GHS 50/hr"
*   **The Spark Way:** "Mental Math Mastery: 8-Week intensive for grade 4-6 - GHS 600"

Start thinking: What is your 8-week transformation? We'll help you build it during onboarding.

Best,
The STEAM Spark Team
