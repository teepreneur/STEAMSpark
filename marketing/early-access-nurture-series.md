### Day 3: Positioning Yourself (Be Unique)
**Theme:** "Don't just be a tutor. Be a brand."

#### 📧 Email 2
**Subject:** Don't just be a "Math Tutor" 🧢
**Preview Text:** Here is how to stand out on the marketplace.

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

Here is a hard truth: Parents don’t just buy "tutoring." They buy **outcomes** and **connection**.

On STEAM Spark, you aren't just a name on a list. You are a brand.

**How to stand out:**

❌ **Boring:** "I teach JHS Math."
✅ **Unique:** "I turn Math anxiety into A-grades using visuals and games."

❌ **Boring:** "Robotics teacher available."
✅ **Unique:** "I help kids build their first robot in 4 weeks."

**Your Homework:**
Think about your "One Line Promise." What is the one specific result you promise parents? Write it down. We'll use it for your profile headline soon.

Stay unique,
The STEAM Spark Team

### Day 5: The "Referral" Push
**Theme:** "Tribes win together."

#### 💬 WhatsApp Broadcast 2
**Message:**
"👋 Quick question, [Name]:

Who is the *best* teacher you know? (Besides yourself 😉)

We have a few slots left in Early Access, and we want to fill them with quality educators like you. We trust your judgment more than a random application.

**Share the opportunity:**
Forward the link below to your top 1-2 teacher friends. If they mention your name, we'll fast-track their application.

🔗 [Link to Early Access Application]

Let's build a powerhouse community! 💪"

#### 📧 Email 3
**Subject:** Who else deserves this? 🤝
**Preview Text:** Invite your best educator friends to join the movement.

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

Great platforms are built on great communities.

You are already in, but we know you have colleagues who are just as passionate, talented, and ready for more than just a typical classroom job.

We successfully onboarded our first batch, but we saved a few Early Access spots for **referrals from our Founding Educators**.

**Why invite them?**
*   **Community:** It is more fun to grow with friends.
*   **Quality:** You know who the real top-tier teachers are.
*   **Influence:** Help shape the standard of STEAM education in Ghana.

Forward them this link and tell them to mention your name: [Link]

Let’s build the future together.

Best,
The STEAM Spark Team

## 📅 Week 2: Success Tactics

### Day 8: Creating Courses That Sell
**Theme:** "Solve problems, don't just sell time."

#### 📧 Email 4
**Subject:** The secret to courses that sell 🤫 #MoneyMoves
**Preview Text:** Stop trading time for money. Start selling transformation.

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

Most tutors charge by the hour.
**Creative Educators sell packages.**

On STEAM Spark, you can create "Gigs" (Specific Courses/Programs).

**Which one sounds more valuable to a parent?**
Option A: "1 hour of Coding tuition - GHS 100"
Option B: "Build Your Own Website: 4-Week Crash Course - GHS 500"

Option B wins every time. It has a clear goal, a specific timeline, and a tangible outcome.

**Start Brainstorming:**
If you could package your skills into a 4-week or 8-week program, what would it be?

*   "Zero to Hero in Phonics"
*   "Junior Python Developer Bootcamp"
*   "Science Fair Wining Projects"

Start planning your signature package now.

To your success,
The STEAM Spark Team

### Day 10: The Power of Consistency
**Theme:** "Reliability is your best marketing."

#### 💬 WhatsApp Broadcast 3
**Voice Note Script (or Text):**
"Hey team! Just a quick tip as we get closer to launch. 💡

The #1 thing parents look for isn't just 'smart' teachers—it is **reliable** teachers.

When we launch, the algorithm loves consistency.
*   Being on time for sessions.
*   Responding to messages quickly.
*   Keeping your calendar updated.

The teachers who show up consistently in the first month are the ones who will dominate the rankings for the rest of the year.

Get your calendars ready! 🗓️"
