# STEAM Spark Marketing & Growth Strategy
**Goal:** Leverage the new platform features to transition from a manual service to a scalable tech product.

## 1. The "Trust & Tech" Campaign (Parents)
**Hook:** "The STEAM education you trust, now with the visibility you deserve."

We need to bridge the gap between the manual service (high trust, low visibility) and the new app (high visibility, new behavior).

### Key Messages:
-   **"See What They Learn":** Highlight the **Parent Dashboard** and **AI Roadmaps**. Parents finally get a window into their child's progress.
-   **"Trusted Tutors, Vetted by Us":** Use the "Verified" badge and profile completeness to show quality.
-   **"Secure & Simple":** Emphasize the new **Paystack integration**. No more awkward cash handling or manual transfers.

### Action Items:
-   [ ] **Email Blast to Existing 150+ Families:** Announce the new "Parent Portal". Frame it as an upgrade to their experience, not just a new tool.
-   [ ] **"Golden Ticket" Invites:** Give existing parents 3 invite codes for friends to get 10% off their first booking.
-   [ ] **Dashboard Demos:** Create short video walkthroughs (using the new UI) showing how easy it is to track progress.

## 2. The "Teach & Earn" Campaign (Teachers)
**Hook:** "Focus on teaching. We handle the rest."

Teachers are tired of chasing payments and administrative work. The platform solves this *instantly* with the new automated payouts.

### Key Messages:
-   **"Guaranteed Payments":** Highlight the **Teacher Wallet** and split payments. Money is held securely and released upon completion.
-   **"Your Professional Portfolio":** The **Teacher Profile** is their new CV. Reviews, ratings, and course listings build their personal brand.
-   **"Automated Scheduling":** The **Calendar** feature means no more back-and-forth WhatsApp tag.

### Action Items:
-   [ ] **Onboard the Top 10:** Hand-pick the best 10 teachers from the existing network. Help them build *perfect* profiles with video intros and detailed courses.
-   [ ] **"Teacher Success" Stories:** Interview a teacher who has benefitted from the manual service and explain how the *app* makes it even better.
-   [ ] **WhatsApp Status Campaign:** Provide teachers with professional graphics of their profiles to share on their own WhatsApp statuses.

## 3. Launch Strategy: "The Spark 100"
**Goal:** Get the first 100 *platform* bookings (distinct from manual bookings).

-   **Offer:** "First 100 bookings get a free personalized AI Learning Roadmap."
-   **Scarcity:** "Limited beta slots for the new AI features."
-   **Channel:** Direct WhatsApp & Email to the existing warm list.

## 4. Pitch Deck Alignment
We need to update the Pitch Deck to reflect that the *tech is live*.

-   **Update "Product" Slide:** Replace mockups with actual screenshots of the new dashboards (we have these now!).
-   **Update "Traction" Slide:** Add a "Tech Growth" metric (e.g., "Platform Beta Launched: 50 Users Onboarded in Week 1").
