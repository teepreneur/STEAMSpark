### Day 11 (Thursday) - Thought Leadership (LinkedIn)
**Article: "Why the 'Gig Economy' Failed Teachers (And How We're Fixing It)"**

**Outline:**
1.  **The Problem:** Most platforms treat teachers like Uber drivers—expandable, nameless, and underpaid.
2.  **The 'Middleman' Trap:** Agencies taking 40-50% cuts just for making an intro.
3.  **The Data:** 67% of tutors we surveyed in Accra cite "delayed payments" as their #1 stress.
4.  **The Solution:** A "Creator Economy" model for teachers.
    - Teachers as talent/creators.
    - Platform provides the tools (billing, booking, marketing).
    - Teachers keep the control (and the majority of earnings).
5.  **The Vision:** We aren't building a tutoring agency. We are building the "Shopify for Education" in Ghana.

**CTA:** "Agree? We're selecting 50 founding educators to prove this model works. Join us."
