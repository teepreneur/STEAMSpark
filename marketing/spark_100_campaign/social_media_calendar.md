❓ Ever wondered what your child actually learns in their robotics class?

Most parents pay for STEAM tutoring and hope for the best. No visibility. No progress updates. Just trust.

That changes TODAY.

With STEAM Spark's new Parent Dashboard, you can:
✅ See every lesson your child completes
✅ Track their skill growth in real-time
✅ Message tutors directly
✅ Access personalized AI learning roadmaps

Education shouldn't be a black box. 📦❌

**Platform:** Facebook  
**Type:** Text + Image

```
⚡️ MYTH vs. REALITY: STEAM Education in Ghana

MYTH: "STEAM education is only for 'smart' kids"
REALITY: Every child can learn to code, build robots, and think like a scientist. It's about finding the right teacher and approach.

MYTH: "It's too expensive"
REALITY: STEAM Spark sessions start at GHS 40/hour. Less than a movie ticket for a skill that lasts a lifetime.

MYTH: "My child is too young"
REALITY: We've taught students as young as 6. Early exposure = bigger advantage.

MYTH: "I need to understand tech to help them"
REALITY: Our teachers handle the teaching. The AI roadmap handles the planning. You just track progress.
