## INSIDE LEFT PANEL — The Problem

### Is Your Child Missing Out on STEAM Education?

Most Ghanaian parents face these challenges:

❌ **Can't find qualified STEAM tutors**  
Finding a good robotics or coding teacher feels impossible.

❌ **No idea what they're learning**  
You pay for tutoring with zero visibility into progress.

❌ **Expensive & unpredictable**  
Sessions cost a fortune, and tutors don't always show up.

❌ **Generic curriculums**  
One-size-fits-all approaches don't match your child's potential.

---

> **The Result?** Your bright child never discovers their love for engineering, coding, or science because the right opportunity never came.
