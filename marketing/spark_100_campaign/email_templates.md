### Email 2: Feature Highlight (Day 3)
**Subject:** See Exactly What [Child's Name] Learns (New Feature Alert 📊)

**Preview Text:** No more wondering "What did they do today?"

**Body:**
```
Hi [Parent Name],

Pop quiz: What did [Child's Name] learn in their last tutoring session?

If your answer is "Uh... something about robots?" — you're not alone.

Traditional tutoring is a black box. You pay, you hope, you trust.

But what if you could SEE their progress in real-time?

---

Introducing: Your Parent Dashboard

[SCREENSHOT OF DASHBOARD]

Every time [Child's Name] completes a session, you'll see:
• Skills they practiced (e.g., "Python loops", "Motor control")
• Projects they built (photos included)
• Next steps in their learning journey
• Tutor notes and feedback

No more guessing. Full transparency.

### Email 3: Social Proof (Day 5)
**Subject:** How Kwame went from zero to Africa Code Champion

**Preview Text:** (And how [Child's Name] can do the same)

**Body:**
```
Hi [Parent Name],

2 years ago, Kwame's mom signed him up for STEAM Spark.

He was 10. He didn't know what a variable was. He'd never written a line of code.

Last month? He won the Africa Code Challenge. 🏆

Continental Champion. Competing against 15 countries.

---

What Changed?

It wasn't just talent. It was:
1. The right educator (matched to his learning style)
2. Consistent practice (weekly sessions, never missed)
3. A personalized roadmap (he leveled up step-by-step)

Now, the same system that helped Kwame win is available to [Child's Name].

The STEAM Spark platform gives you:
✅ Vetted educators (like Kwame's tutor)
✅ AI-personalized roadmaps (tailored to [Child's Name]'s pace)
✅ Progress tracking (so you never lose momentum)

---

[Child's Name]'s coding journey could start today.

Will they be the next champion?

I know life is busy. I know you're weighing options.

"If [Child's Name] discovers a passion for robotics or coding through STEAM Spark... and it shapes their career, their university path, their entire future... will I regret not giving them this opportunity?"

You've trusted us for [X years/months]. We want to make this next chapter even better.

## Email Sequence 2: For New Parents (Cold/Warm Leads)

### Email 1: Introduction + Pain Point
**Subject:** Is your child missing out on STEAM education?

**Preview Text:** Most Accra parents don't know these opportunities exist...

**Body:**
```
Hi there,

Quick question: Does your child's school offer robotics? Coding? Hands-on science experiments?

If you answered "no" (or "I'm not sure"), your child is part of the 90% of Ghanaian students who never get exposed to STEAM education.

Here's why that's a problem:
• Universities prioritize applicants with STEAM portfolios
• Tech careers are the fastest-growing (and highest-paying) in Ghana
• Critical thinking and problem-solving start young

But finding good STEAM tutors? Nearly impossible.

---

Until now.

STEAM Spark is Ghana's first marketplace connecting your child with vetted educators in robotics, coding, and science.

We've spent 7 years building this. Our students win continental competitions. We're backed by international grants.

And we're opening our platform to 100 founding families.

Want to see how it works?

Founder, STEAM Spark Ghana

P.S. We're not another "coding bootcamp". We're a curated network of 50+ passionate educators, backed by AI to personalize your child's journey.

### Email 2: Credibility + Offer
**Subject:** 🏆 Our students win international competitions. Here's how.

**Body:**
```
Hi,

When 10-year-old Nana joined STEAM Spark, she'd never touched a computer.

18 months later? Continental Coding Champion.

How?

1. **Matched with the Right Educator** — Not just anyone. Someone who understood her learning style.
2. **Consistent Practice** — Weekly sessions, building on each lesson.
3. **Personalized Roadmap** — AI-guided path from beginner to advanced.

Now, you can give your child the same advantage.
