### **1. Problem & Focus**
**Question:** *What is the specific problem you are trying to address? Describe the problem with your area of focus. Try to explain the magnitude of this problem in Ghana. Include any evidence that discusses the problem.*

**Answer:** 
The primary problem STEAM Spark addresses is the lack of accessibility and quality in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) education for Grade 1-12 students in Ghana. This problem is trifurcated:

1.  **Accessibility Gap:** While the Ghanaian government has pushed for a STEM-focused agenda, quality education remains locked behind expensive private school walls or inaccessible tutoring agencies.
2.  **Educator Disenfranchisement:** Talented STEAM educators in Ghana are marginalized by traditional tutoring agencies that take 40-50% commission, pay late (often 30-60 days), and provide no tools for professional growth. A survey of tutors in Accra revealed that 67% cite "delayed payments" as their #1 professional stressor.
3.  **Parental Blindness:** Parents have zero visibility into their child’s learning progress, relying on anecdotal feedback rather than data-driven roadmaps.

**Magnitude:** With over 9 million students in Ghana’s basic education system, the demand for supplementary STEAM training is exploding, yet the "supply" side (qualified educators) is shrinking due to poor working conditions and a lack of creative freedom.

### **2. The Solution**
**Question:** *What is your solution? Describe how your solution works. As much as possible, talk about the technology behind your solution if there is any evidence to support your work, discuss it and provide any relevant links for us.*

**Answer:**
STEAM Spark is Africa’s first AI-powered marketplace for STEAM education—effectively the "Shopify for STEAM Educators." Our solution is a two-sided platform that connects vetted educators with families seeking personalized, high-outcome tutoring.

**How it works:**
*   **For Educators:** We provide a "business-in-a-box" where they own their curriculum, set their own rates, and get paid directly via integrated Mobile Money and Card systems. We take a sustainable 20% commission (vs. the industry standard 50%).
*   **For Parents:** We offer a discovery engine to find vetted experts and use AI to generate personalized **Learning Roadmaps** that adapt to a child’s specific interests and pace.

**Technology:**
*   **Frontend:** Built with **Next.js 15** for high performance and SEO.
*   **Backend:** Powered by **Supabase** for real-time notifications, secure data handling, and scalable infrastructure.
*   **AI Integration:** We use Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze student performance and generate personalized learning paths and "Gigs" (signature courses).
*   **Evidence:** We have operated as a manual service for 7 years, training 140+ children and serving 150+ homes. Our students have won the **Africa Code Challenge** and participated in the **CoderZ Robotics League**, proving that our curriculum model works.

### **3. Learning Outcomes & Impact**
**Question:** *Tell us how your solution focuses on improving learning outcomes. Help us understand your impact indicators or goals and how your solution is working towards them (e.g., pre-test / post-test). | How do you define and measure student learning outcomes? | What evidence do you have that your solution improves learning outcomes? | What are your key performance indicators for educational impact? | How do you track long-term student progress and retention of learning?*

**Answer:**
**Impact Strategy:** We improve learning outcomes by moving from "passive tutoring" to "active project-based learning." 

**Definition & Measurement:**
We define outcomes through **Competency-Based Milestones**. Instead of just grades, we measure:
1.  **Project Completion Rate:** Can the student build the robot/app they planned?
2.  **Logic & Reasoning:** Measured through periodic AI-assisted assessments.
3.  **Retention:** Quarterly "Success Check-ins" that revisit previous concepts through new, more complex challenges.

**Evidence:**
Our learners don't just "study"—they compete. Our students were continental winners in the **Africa Code Challenge**, demonstrating mastery of complex coding logic against peers across Africa. 

**KPIs for Impact:**
*   **Competency Score:** Pre-test vs. Post-test score improvement (Target: >35% improvement per course).
*   **Engagement:** Average hours spent on hands-on STEAM projects weekly.
*   **Skill Diversification:** Number of children moving from one STEAM pillar (e.g., Math) to another (e.g., Robotics).

**Tracking:** Our platform utilizes a **Longitudinal Student Dashboard** where every achievement, assignment, and feedback note is stored, allowing parents and educators to see progress over years, not just weeks.

**Secondary Data:**
**Question:** *Do you rely on secondary data from partners etc.? How do you validate this?*

**Answer:** 
Yes, we rely on secondary data for market sizing and regional educational trends (e.g., student enrollment numbers from the Ministry of Education and EdTech growth projections from industry reports like HolonIQ). We validate this data by cross-referencing it with our own primary data gathered over 7 years of manual operation. For instance, when industry reports suggest a high demand for coding, we correlate this with our internal booking data and regional educator availability to ensure real-world alignment.

### **4. Strategic Alignment**
**Question:** *Is your solution aligned with Ghana’s ICT in Education Policy or National Reform Agenda? | If yes, how is your solution aligned with Ghana’s ICT in Education Policy, Education Strategic Plan 2018 - 2030 and or National Reform Agenda?*

**Answer:**
Yes, STEAM Spark is directly aligned with the **Education Strategic Plan (ESP) 2018-2030** and the **National STEM Agenda**.

*   **ESP 2018-2030:** Our platform addresses the "Quality of Learning" and "Relevance of Education" goals by providing market-relevant skills (Coding, Robotics, Engineering) that the current school system is still struggling to integrate at scale.
*   **ICT in Education Policy:** We support the government's mandate to bridge the digital divide by training educators (to become digital-first) and providing students with the technical literacy required for the 4th Industrial Revolution.
*   **Teacher Professional Development:** Our model aligns with the reform to improve teacher status and earnings by providing them with the tools to become educational entrepreneurs, thus increasing teacher retention in the STEM sector.

### **5. Scaling & Challenges**
**Question:** *What is the primary challenge(s) your company is facing in building and deploying your solution? | Who are the stakeholders or partners you think will help you reach the scale you have described?*

**Answer:**
**Primary Challenges:**
1.  **Technology Acquisition:** Transitioning our 7-year manual operation into a robust, AI-integrated platform requires significant capital for development and infrastructure.
2.  **Market Awareness:** Educating parents that STEAM is a necessity, not an elective, requires intensive marketing.
3.  **Vetting at Scale:** As we grow from 50 to 500+ teachers, maintaining our "vetted high-quality" standard requires automated but rigorous screening tools.

**Stakeholders for Scale:**
*   **Ministry of Education / GES:** For potential B2B licenses for public schools.
*   **Universities (STEM/Education Depts):** To create a pipeline of high-quality student-teachers.
*   **Telcos (MTN/Vodafone):** For zero-rating educational data and integrating mobile money payments at scale.
*   **Mastercard Foundation:** For credibility, funding, and access to a Pan-African network of EdTech innovators.

### **6. Fellowship Motivation & Benefit**
**Question:** *Why are you interested in this program? | How do you see your solution making a difference in Ghana’s education system? | How will the Mastercard Foundation EdTech Fellowship benefit the work you are doing now? How do you envision the program helping you overcome your challenges and achieve the scale you have described?*

**Answer:**
**Motivation:** We are at a critical inflection point. We have 7 years of proof and $20,000+ in annual revenue from a manual model. We are applying because the Mastercard Foundation EdTech Fellowship is the premier catalyst for scaling high-impact education solutions in Africa.

**Benefit:**
*   **Overcoming Financial Barriers:** The $100,000 funding will directly accelerate our product roadmap (AI personalizers, teacher dashboards).
*   **Mentorship & Credibility:** Being a "Mastercard Fellow" provides the institutional credibility needed to partner with schools and government agencies.
*   **Scaling Impact:** The fellowship will help us transition from serving 150 families to reaching 10,000+ across Ghana and eventually West Africa.

**Impact on Ghana:** STEAM Spark will decentralize quality education. We will make it so that a child in a middle-income home in Kumasi has access to the same world-class robotics instruction as a child in an elite international school in Accra. We aren't just improving grades; we are building Africa's next generation of inventors and engineers.
